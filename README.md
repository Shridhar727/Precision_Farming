# Precision_Farming
This is an SIH2023 problem statement for which me and my team are providing solution and we call it Precision_Farming.
Our team's name is Circuit Aura and we've given are best in accomplishing this project. 
# Problem Statement 
Automatic regulation of valves for release of water
based upon soil moisture availability in the root zone of the crop, using artificial
intelligence, in a piped and micro irrigation network of irrigation system.
